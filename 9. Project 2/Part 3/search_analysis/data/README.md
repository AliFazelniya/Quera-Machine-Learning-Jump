# data

Datasets required by notebooks in the parent module.

## Files

- `iran_cities.csv` — Reference list of Iranian cities for normalization and analysis.
- `mrbilit_search.json` — User search logs for analysis and suggestion tasks.

## How to Use

These datasets are inputs for notebooks in the parent directory. Keep filenames unchanged so notebooks run without edits.
