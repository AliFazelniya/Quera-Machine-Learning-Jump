# notebook

Notebooks that contain step-by-step analysis, modeling, and results.

## Files

- `screenshot.png` — Screenshot of results or UI output.
- `submission.csv` — Submission-ready predictions generated by the notebook.

## How to Use

Open the notebooks and run cells in order. Ensure the `data` folder is present and matches expected filenames.
