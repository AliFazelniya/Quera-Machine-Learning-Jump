## Course Overview

The course is designed as a practical learning path from fundamentals to applied projects. The official page highlights a large number of lessons and exercises, plus a time-boxed completion window once you reach the Data Preparation chapter. The course also includes two major projects: one focused on text/NLP and another focused on passenger data modeling and cancellation prediction.

## Who This Course Is For

The course is suitable if you want a structured, end-to-end path in machine learning and plan to build a portfolio with real projects. It is not ideal if you want a shallow overview or are unwilling to invest consistent weekly time.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming
- Familiarity with NumPy and Pandas
- High school level mathematics

The course does **not** require a formal CS degree or advanced algorithmic background.

## Course Headings

- Project Management Tips
- Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
- Regression Techniques
- Classification Algorithms
- Model Evaluation, Selection, and Regularization
- Artificial Neural Networks
- Natural Language Processing Basics
- Unsupervised Learning and Clustering

## How to Use This Repository

1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. Launch Jupyter or JupyterLab.
3. Start with `1. Data preparation` and proceed in order.
4. Each practice/project contains a `notebooks` folder and a `data` folder.
5. Run notebook cells sequentially to reproduce results and generate outputs.

## Output Artifacts

Many practices and projects generate `submission.csv` files. These are formatted for evaluation, grading, or leaderboard submission.

## Notes

Some course materials such as video lessons and theory-only chapters (e.g., project management tips) are hosted directly on the Quera platform and may not appear as files in this repository.
