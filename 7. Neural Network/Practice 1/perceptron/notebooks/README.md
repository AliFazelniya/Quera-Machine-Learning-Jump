- `delta_rule.png` — Image asset produced or used by the notebook.
- `df1.csv` — Simple dataset for perceptron/Adaline.
- `df2.csv` — Simple dataset for perceptron/Adaline.
- `df3.csv` — Simple dataset for perceptron/Adaline.
- `linearly_separable.json` — Synthetic data for perceptron learning.
- `perceptron.ipynb` — Implements Perceptron and Adaline learning, compares convergence behavior, and visualizes results.
- `perceptron_rule.png` — Image asset produced or used by the notebook.

## How to Use

Open the notebooks and run cells in order. Ensure the `data` folder is present and matches expected filenames.
